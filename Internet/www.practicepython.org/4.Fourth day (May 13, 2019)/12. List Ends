# Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only
# the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.

    new_list = [list_in[0], list_in[-1]]
    return new_list


example_list = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
